Learn ML

Research on the application of ML in communication networks is described in:
i) the three layers, i.e., physical, access, and network layers; and 
ii) novel computing and networking concepts such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), and a brief overview of ML-based network security.
